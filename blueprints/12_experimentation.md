# Experimentation & Tracking

## Running Experiments

- Define experiment goals and hypotheses
- Use configuration files to control parameters
- Automate experiment runs where possible

## Tracking

- Log parameters, metrics, and results for each run
- Use experiment tracking tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Store experiment metadata with model artifacts

## Best Practices

- Keep experiments reproducible (fixed seeds, documented configs)
- Compare results systematically
- Document findings and lessons learned
