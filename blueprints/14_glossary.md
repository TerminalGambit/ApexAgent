# Glossary

**Agentic AI:** AI systems that act autonomously, make decisions, and adapt to changing environments.

**FastF1:** A Python library for accessing and analyzing Formula 1 telemetry and timing data.

**Feature Store:** A centralized repository for storing, managing, and versioning engineered features for ML models.

**Feature Cross:** The combination of two or more features to capture interactions between them.

**Embeddings:** Dense vector representations of categorical variables, enabling models to learn relationships between categories.

**Windowed Inference:** Making predictions over sliding windows of data (e.g., next 5 laps).

**Batch Serving:** Processing multiple prediction requests at once, rather than one at a time.

**Explainability:** Techniques and tools that help interpret and understand model predictions.

**Fairness:** Ensuring that models do not produce biased or discriminatory outcomes.

**Reproducibility:** The ability to consistently reproduce results using the same code, data, and configuration.

**Telemetry:** Detailed data collected from F1 cars, including speed, position, and sensor readings.

**Model Versioning:** Tracking and managing different versions of trained models for traceability and rollback.
