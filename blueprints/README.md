# F1-ML Project Blueprints

Welcome to the **Blueprints** directory of the F1-ML project. This space is dedicated to the design, philosophy, and engineering principles that guide the development of a robust, responsible, and impactful AI system for Formula 1 data analytics.

## Purpose

This directory documents the foundational thinking, design patterns, and stepwise approach behind the project. It serves as both a guide for contributors and a learning resource for anyone interested in building real-world, responsible AI systems.

## Philosophy

- **Engineering for Impact:** We believe in building systems that are not only functional, but also robust, transparent, and responsible.
- **Learning by Doing:** Each phase is an opportunity to learn, reflect, and improveâ€”both as engineers and as educators.
- **Open Knowledge:** By documenting our process, we aim to help others learn from our journey and contribute to the field.

## Structure

Each markdown file in this directory describes a key phase or principle of the project, including:

- Project vision and goals
- Data pipeline and engineering
- Feature store and representation
- Modeling and training patterns
- Serving, monitoring, and explainability
- Testing and reproducibility
- Responsible AI and fairness

We hope this blueprint inspires you to build, learn, and lead in the world of AI engineering.
