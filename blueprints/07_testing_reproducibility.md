# Phase 6: Testing & Reproducibility

## Overview

Testing and reproducibility are essential for building reliable, maintainable AI systems.

## Key Steps

- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Ensure each component works as intended, both in isolation and together.
- **Reproducible Splits:** Use fixed seeds and documented procedures for data splits.
- **Model Versioning:** Track and manage model versions for traceability.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automate testing and deployment with continuous integration tools (e.g., GitHub Actions).

## Testing Matrix
| Component         | Unit Test | Integration Test | Automated in CI |
|-------------------|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Data Extraction   |     ✓     |        ✓         |        ✓        |
| Feature Store     |     ✓     |        ✓         |        ✓        |
| Modeling          |     ✓     |        ✓         |        ✓        |
| Serving API       |     ✓     |        ✓         |        ✓        |

## Best Practices
- Write tests for all new code and features
- Use mocks and fixtures for external dependencies
- Ensure all tests pass before merging changes
- Document test coverage and known limitations

## Principles

- **Reliability:** Automated tests catch errors early and ensure stability.
- **Reproducibility:** Anyone can reproduce results using the same code and data.

## Outcome

A robust, maintainable codebase that supports confident experimentation and deployment.
