# Phase 6: Testing & Reproducibility

## Overview

Testing and reproducibility are essential for building reliable, maintainable AI systems.

## Key Steps

- **Unit & Integration Tests:** Ensure each component works as intended, both in isolation and together.
- **Reproducible Splits:** Use fixed seeds and documented procedures for data splits.
- **Model Versioning:** Track and manage model versions for traceability.

## Principles

- **Reliability:** Automated tests catch errors early and ensure stability.
- **Reproducibility:** Anyone can reproduce results using the same code and data.

## Outcome

A robust, maintainable codebase that supports confident experimentation and deployment.
