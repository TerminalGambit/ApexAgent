# Phase 5: Monitoring, Explainability & Fairness

## Overview

Ensuring the AI system remains robust, fair, and explainable after deployment is critical for responsible AI.

## Key Steps

- **Monitoring:** Track predictions, errors, and data drift over time.
- **Explainability:** Use tools like SHAP or LIME to explain model decisions.
- **Fairness:** Analyze and mitigate biases (e.g., by driver, team, or season).
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for all components.

## Principles

- **Responsibility:** Proactively address explainability and fairness.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use monitoring insights to refine models and processes.

## Outcome

A trustworthy, transparent AI system that meets high standards of responsibility and reliability.
