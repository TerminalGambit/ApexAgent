# Phase 2: Feature Store & Representation

## Overview

Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. A feature store abstracts and manages these features for reuse and versioning.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Store:** Central repository for engineered features, supporting reuse and versioning.
- **Feature Cross:** Combine multiple features (e.g., driver x team) to capture interactions.
- **Embeddings:** Represent categorical variables in a dense, learnable format.

## Example Feature Definitions

- `driver_team_cross = driver_id + '_' + team_id`
- `avg_lap_time_last_5 = rolling_mean(lap_time, window=5)`
- `track_temp_embedding = embedding(track_temp)`

## Versioning Strategies

- Store features with version tags (e.g., `v1.0-driver_team_cross`)
- Document feature changes in a changelog

## Feature Selection & Importance

- Use statistical tests and model-based methods (e.g., feature importances from tree models)
- Regularly review and update feature sets for optimal performance

## Principles

- **Reusability:** Features are defined once and reused across models.
- **Versioning:** Track changes to features for reproducibility.

## Outcome

A flexible, maintainable feature engineering process that accelerates experimentation and ensures consistency.
