# Phase 2: Feature Store & Representation

## Overview

Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful inputs for machine learning models. A feature store abstracts and manages these features for reuse and versioning.

## Key Concepts

- **Feature Store:** Central repository for engineered features, supporting reuse and versioning.
- **Feature Cross:** Combine multiple features (e.g., driver x team) to capture interactions.
- **Embeddings:** Represent categorical variables in a dense, learnable format.

## Principles

- **Reusability:** Features are defined once and reused across models.
- **Versioning:** Track changes to features for reproducibility.

## Outcome

A flexible, maintainable feature engineering process that accelerates experimentation and ensures consistency.
