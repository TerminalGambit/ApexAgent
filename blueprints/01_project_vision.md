# Project Vision & Goals

## Vision

To build a robust, responsible, and extensible AI system that leverages Formula 1 data to deliver predictive analytics, foster learning, and set a standard for engineering excellence in real-world machine learning projects.

## Why Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems are designed to act autonomously, adapt to new data, and make decisions in dynamic environmentsâ€”just like a Formula 1 team must do during a race. By focusing on agentic principles, this project aims to:

- Enable proactive, context-aware analytics
- Support interactive, user-driven workflows
- Foster transparency and trust in AI-driven decisions

## Goals

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** Design a modular workflow from data extraction to model serving and monitoring.
- **Responsible AI:** Prioritize transparency, fairness, and reproducibility at every stage.
- **Educational Value:** Document and explain each phase to help others learn and contribute.
- **Portfolio Quality:** Create a project that is impactful, well-structured, and worthy of showcasing.

## Use Cases

- Predict race outcomes or driver performance based on historical and real-time data
- Analyze and compare team strategies across seasons
- Provide explainable insights for fans, analysts, and engineers

## User Stories

- *As a data scientist*, I want to experiment with different features and models, so I can improve prediction accuracy.
- *As a fan*, I want to explore race data and predictions through an interactive dashboard, so I can better understand the sport.
- *As an engineer*, I want to ensure the system is robust, fair, and reproducible, so it can be trusted and maintained.

## Motivation

Formula 1 is a data-rich environment, making it an ideal playground for applying and demonstrating advanced machine learning and engineering practices. By building this project, we aim to:

- Explore real-world predictive analytics challenges
- Apply and document best practices in ML engineering
- Inspire and educate others in the field
