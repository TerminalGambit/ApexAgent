### 1. **Data Monitor Backend (`data_monitor.py`)**
- **Automated Data Scanning**: Recursively scans all data directories (`raw/`, `processed/`, `analysis/`, `predictions/`)
- **Multi-Season Support**: Monitors both 2024 and 2025 F1 data
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Tracks data quality, pipeline completion, feature consistency
- **Real-time Reporting**: Generates JSON reports for dashboard consumption

### 2. **Flask Integration (`app.py`)**
- **New Route**: `/data-monitoring` endpoint added to Flask application
- **Data Visualization**: Creates interactive Plotly charts for pipeline status, data volumes, and feature analysis
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when data is not available
- **Auto-refresh**: Monitoring data updates dynamically

### 3. **Dashboard UI (`data_monitoring.html`)**
- **Hero Section**: Professional data monitoring center interface
- **Summary Statistics**: High-level metrics (total races, laps, data size, features)
- **Pipeline Status**: Visual progress bars showing completion percentages by year
- **Data Quality Tables**: Race-by-race breakdown with quality scores and status badges
- **Feature Analysis**: Consistency metrics and top feature charts
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for pipeline improvements

## 📊 Monitoring Capabilities

### **Data Coverage Analysis**
```
📈 Current Data Status:
- 2024 Season: 75.0% pipeline completion (1 race processed)
- 2025 Season: 52.5% pipeline completion (10 races processed)
- Total: 11 races, 7,606 laps, 21.4 MB data
```

### **Pipeline Stage Tracking**
- ✅ **Raw Ingestion**: Data downloaded from FastF1 API
