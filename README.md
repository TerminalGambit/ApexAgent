# ApexAgent: Agentic AI for Formula 1 Analytics

ApexAgent is an open-source project that brings agentic, responsible, and robust AI engineering to the world of Formula 1 data analytics. Leveraging the FastF1 API, this project aims to build an end-to-end pipeline—from data extraction to interactive dashboards—while prioritizing transparency, reproducibility, and real-world impact.

## Project Vision

To create a modular, extensible, and responsible AI system that empowers users to explore, predict, and understand Formula 1 racing through data-driven insights and agentic intelligence.

## Key Features

- **Agentic AI Pipeline:** Modular workflow for data extraction, feature engineering, modeling, and serving.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** User-friendly web interface for exploration, prediction, and model explainability.
- **Responsible AI:** Emphasis on fairness, transparency, and reproducibility at every stage.
- **Educational Blueprints:** Comprehensive documentation of design patterns, engineering principles, and project phases.

## Project Phases

1. **Data Pipeline & Engineering:** Extract, store, and preprocess F1 data from FastF1.
2. **Feature Store & Representation:** Engineer, version, and manage reusable features.
3. **Modeling & Training:** Build, train, and evaluate predictive models with responsible practices.
4. **Serving & Dashboard:** Deliver predictions and insights through an interactive Flask app.
5. **Monitoring & Explainability:** Track, explain, and ensure fairness in model predictions.
6. **Testing & Reproducibility:** Maintain reliability and reproducibility through rigorous testing.

## Getting Started
