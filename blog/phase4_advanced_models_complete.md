## Technical Deep Dive

### Data Leakage Resolution Process

**Problem Identification:**
Our Phase 3 models achieved perfect scores (RMSE: 0.000), indicating data leakage where features contained information that wouldn't be available at prediction time.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Time-based leakage**: Features like `leader_lap_time` and `car_ahead_time` included current lap performance
- **Position-dependent features**: Rankings and gaps calculated using current lap results
- **Team averages**: Calculations that included the current lap being predicted

**Solution Implementation:**
```python
# Removed leaky features
features_to_remove = [
    'leader_lap_time',      # Same as min LapTime for current lap
    'car_ahead_time',       # LapTime of car ahead
    'team_avg_lap_time',    # Includes current lap
    'best_lap_so_far',      # Cumulative minimum includes current lap
    'gap_to_leader',        # Depends on current lap sorting
    'lap_time_percentile',  # Ranking within current lap
    # ... and 15 more
]
```

### Advanced Model Architecture
